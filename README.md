# Sales Hunt

**Sales Hunt** is a data management project that utilizes time series forecasting to predict item sales by category in a supermarket chain. The project leverages LSTM models for accurate forecasting based on 7-day data sequences. The models are hosted using Flask, with a React frontend and MUI for user interactions.

## Features

- **Time Series Forecasting**: Predict item sales across different categories using LSTM models.
- **7-Day Data Sequences**: Models are trained on weekly data for accurate forecasting.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: React frontend with Material-UI (MUI) for intuitive user interactions.
- **Backend Models**: Hosted using Flask for efficient processing and forecasting.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, MUI (Material-UI)
- **Backend**: Flask, Python
- **Machine Learning**: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models for time series forecasting
